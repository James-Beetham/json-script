## About
We wanted to create our own platform where we could all hop on a website and communicate with each other. The main appeal of this application is that it's made for programmers. Users are able to enter certain commands to interface with the application, such as whispering with other users, and even full blown javascript!

## FAQ
- To whisper a user, either click their name in the “Online Users” section to auto fill or simply type: /w <user’s name> <your message>
- To test with two different accounts, you MUST use two different browsers. - Otherwise, you will be logged into the same account just on a different tab.
- To add a picture to your profile, simply find any picture/gif that you want, right click -> copy image address -> paste into profile image URL box and then click the Update Profile Picture button.
